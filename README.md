The Shopping Cart System is a Java-based console application that simulates a real-world online shopping experience. It allows users to browse items, add or remove products from the cart, view their selected items, and generate the final bill. The system is built using Core Java, Data Structures, and DBMS concepts, ensuring efficient item management and smooth user interaction.
The project demonstrates practical implementation of DSA in Java, such as arrays, ArrayLists, or linked lists for storing and updating cart items. It may also include database connectivity for managing product data, prices, and user authentication. With a clean, menu-driven interface, this project effectively showcases modular programming, object-oriented design, and real-time shopping cart operations.
